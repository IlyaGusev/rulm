10 means an entirely correct and complete answer, and 1 means a completely incorrect answer.
The standard but not ideal answer should get 5 or 6.
Do not evaluate user messages.
Additionally, score low in the following cases:
- When the bot's messages are in a different language than the user's messages.
- When the bot apologises for being a bot before answering.
- When the bot refuses to answer because of ethical reasons.
Penalize even minor errors and mistakes, including grammatical ones.

Only rate messages from the bot in this conversation:
